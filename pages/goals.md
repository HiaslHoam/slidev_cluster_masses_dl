<div class="grid grid-cols-3 justify-center justify-items-center items-start">
<div class="list col-span-2">

* As proven in computer vision, are deep neural networks capable of more accurate predictions for galaxy cluster masses?
* Which deep architectures are suitable for galaxy cluster mass estimation?
* Can we build a pipeline for efficient architecture testing and parameter optimization?
