Training history of all models over 4000 epochs of training. The training loss history is smoothed using the simple moving average over 100 entries. The overfitted basic CNN is shown for comparison not the best performing basic CNN because it only trained for around 100 epochs.

Unsure why some models (such as ResNet101 and EfficientNet-B7) showed very low training loss while predicting very poorly. </div>
