* Way higher accuracies than the VGG models
* V2 of the ResNet models are performing better than V1
* Training is very random and there were many bad runs
* Despite the high accuracy still not as good as the basic CNN
* ResNet152V2 was the most accurate but takes 2.5 times as much computing time as ResNet50V2
